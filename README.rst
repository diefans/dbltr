**********

A proof-of-concept for asynchronous, in memory transfered, remote procedure calls in Python.
This POC uses Python 3.5.2 features and is in no way complete and or fully tested - it serves as an exercise.


Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^

My work, insights and frustrations with Ansible led me to the conclusion, that sooner or later someone will come up with
a maintable approach of the idea to send code to remote machines and execute it.
